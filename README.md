### Hi there 👋

<h3 align="center">A passionate software developer from Noida IND</h3>

I'm Rajesh Choudhary, a web developer originally from Darbhanga, Bihar, now living in Noida, India. My expertise lies in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.js, where I thrive in building modern, scalable, and high-performance web applications.

With over two years of professional experience in frontend development, I’ve mastered the art of creating intuitive and dynamic user interfaces that deliver exceptional user experiences. React.js is my go-to tool, enabling me to craft responsive, optimized, and maintainable web applications. Combined with TypeScript, I ensure my codebase is robust, reliable, and easy to scale.

I’m also committed to exploring cutting-edge technologies and practices, including deployment automation using Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and AWS Services, bridging the gap between development and operations.

Outside of coding, I’m a badminton enthusiast and love diving into new challenges to expand my skills and creativity.

Currently, I am seeking to work with like-minded and ambitious individuals in a team environment at a reputable fir
m. If you have a project that requires my expertise, please consider me for your next project.
